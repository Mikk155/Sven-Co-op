### Irreplaceable client-side sounds

List of irreplaceable sounds since they are client sided and not server sided.

Some sounds are shared with some entities that can be replaced. Soo this list is going to contain only irreplaceable ones.
- Note: It does not include sound events made by models, for now.

# Footsteps

Previously, stepping sounds were irreplaceable. But Giegue made a script for that: [Custom Footsteps](https://github.com/JulianR0/CFootsteps)
