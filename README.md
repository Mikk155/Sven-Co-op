This project has been discontinued due to my lack of interest and Sven co-op's AngelScript having nothing else to teach me.

Consider this project archived and abandonde by me. This is not entirely true and only applies to myself. any pull request fixing a bug or completing any WIP project from the miscellaneous folder are welcomed and will be accepted.

This repository contains a large git commit history of me and my way through here. commiting mistakes, learning how Github works. The game's API and general knowledge on programing since i introduced myself into programing through jumping naked on this game's Scripting engine.

If something in here helps you in any way feel free to yoink it. The licence is being changed to MIT so you must have a header of it in your source and additionaly you MUST credit anyone else who helped in any way, usually these names are written in the scripts headers.
